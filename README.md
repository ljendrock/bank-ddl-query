### Banking Database Creation and Querying

This project was adapted from a database management and querying project completed in my Master's program. The SQL DDL and queries were written and run within PostgreSQL. This was completed in two parts: creation of a banking database, and querying the database to retrieve information on customers, branches and loan/deposit accounts. 

In the first part, six tables were created based on data for a hypothetical multi-branch bank in New York. The tables were linked using both primary and foreign keys. To protect data integrity, constraints were put in place within many of the tables. CASCADE operators were used frequently to protect data integrity in case of updates and/or deletions. Existing data was then inserted into the database.

In the second part, seven queries were completed to pull information from the created database. While many operators were used in these queries, a particular focus was put on JOINs, subqueries, and SET operators. The requested variables are listed in the comments giving the query task, and any requested techniques are listed.
